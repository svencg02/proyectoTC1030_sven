In this project I'll be creating an simple music streaming platform, where a user is created and he can make different playlists, where can be autogenerated or created by the user. The "Father" class would be Playlists and the inheritence would be in the classes Personalized and Generated. Songs would be added to the Playlist class and the User would the last class, were Playlist would be added by compossition. 

The main intention of the project is demonstrate the hability to use pointers and polymorphism.
